# Unlimited_Color_Changer
This code will create an unlimited colour changer that will continuously change its colour after a few seconds. We can adjust the setInterval() function to change the frequency at which the colour changes.

We can also add additional features to your colour changer, such as a button that allows the user to manually change the colour. We can also use CSS to style the colour changer in any way you want.
