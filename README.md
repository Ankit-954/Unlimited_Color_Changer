# Unlimited_Color_Changer
This code will create an unlimited color changer that will continuously change its color after few seconds. We can adjust the setInterval() function to change the frequency at which the color changes.

We can also add additional features to your color changer, such as a button that allows the user to manually change the color. You can also use CSS to style the color changer in any way you want.
